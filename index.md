## **PROJECT 1**: [Loan data manipulation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tEAOS6REF8DmWYsHHN8sdo4j_5P4qBQxCcBbwyxXSvY/edit?usp=sharing)

This is a project in which I have used a loan dataset.  [Click here to see the dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DYB76shXokv-JewlVeU0gy7NzvxKG9IKoA5wcCwWJ64/edit?usp=sharing)              

Source of the dataset: [Click here](https://www.kaggle.com/apartmentguru/exploratory-lending/data)      

I have found out the MM estimate and ML estimate for the column *INSTALLMENT* and compared the two. Also fitted a distribution to check the behaviour of the installment. I performed the **hypothesis testing** for the same as well.
